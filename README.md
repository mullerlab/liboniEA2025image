### Image segmentation with traveling waves in an exactly solvable recurrent neural network

This repository contains the source code from:

[Liboni*, Budzinski*, Busch*, Löwe, Keller, Welling, and Muller (2025) Image segmentation with traveling waves in an exactly solvable recurrent neural network. PNAS 122: e2321319121 *equal contribution](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2321319121)

This paper introduces a complex-valued recurrent neural network (cv-RNN) that can perform image segmentation while being also mathematically solvable. The repository contains the source code (cvrnn_image_segmentation.m) and demonstrates examples of segmenting images with two shapes (example 1), three shapes (example 2), and natural images (example 3).

## Usage

The first code section (labeled “setup”) adds all necessary folders to the MATLAB path. Each script requires only a few minutes to run on a standard desktop workstation.

## Testing

Tested on MATLAB (R2024b) under macOS.
